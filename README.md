# Youtube-Video-Downloader
A python Script to download any video from youtube

I used Beautiful soup to scrape the youtube website and then after getting the link , audio and video are downloaded seperatly.
To merge audio into video before saving ,  ffmpeg.exe file is required (you can download and add to same directory where this script is located).

I created this projecr just to learn webscraping using BeautifulSoup library.
